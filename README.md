#### Set Up
First, change directory to `ansible` belongs to root path in this repo and execute the following command to build ansible server.
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
You can connect instance after creating ansible instance:
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```
Then, checkout a new terminal session on your computer and look up a public key, `ansible/data/id_ecdsa.pub`, without ssh to ansible instance.<br>
Copy the key file you would find to `kubekit/data`.<br>
Change directory to `kubekit` and build vagrant:
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
When initialize by up command is done, ssh to kubekit instance from ansible instance.
```bash
[vagrant@ansible ~]$ ssh vagrant@kubekit.localdomain
The authenticity of host 'kubekit.localdomain (192.168.10.10)' can't be established.
...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

[vagrant@kubekit ~]$
```
